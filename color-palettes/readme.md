# Color Palettes

Usage of the mineral UI color palettes in sketch requires the plugin https://github.com/andrewfiorillo/sketch-palettes

## Setup

We suggest setting grade-60 (default) to your global colors, and loading in other color palettes as needed.

### Replacing global colors with mineral UI

1. After you've installed the plugin, go to Plugins > Sketch Palettes > Clear Palette. This is optional as you palette is adative. 
2. Select global or document palettes, for this example we will clear the global presets.
3. Select Plugins > Sketch Palettes > Load Palette
4. Select the "mineralUI-global.sketchpalette" file which is in color-palettes folder. 
5. In the source dropdown, select Global
6. Click Load
6. When you select an object and the color picker, you should now see the base mineralUI colors in the global colors section of the color picker. Note Sketch includes both a global colors and a document colors palette of swatches at the bottom of the color picker. 

### Replacing document colors with your mineral UI theme colors

1. Repeat steps 1-4 from above, with the exception of step two, clear document presets.
2. After selecting your theme sketch palette file, select "document presets" as your source and click load.
3. Your sketch document should now be ready to design.
